I'm going to make an australia website, just to make sure i am following along with odin
It feels like I understand, but it's easy to kid yourself.

Keep it basic. You can add more if you want later.

Goals:
1) navigate pretty well through making the basic site
2) end strong.
3) learn a little about Australia along the way
