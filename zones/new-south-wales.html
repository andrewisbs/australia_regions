    <h1>New South Wales</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><span class="important-person">James Busby</span> is their ‘father’ of viticulture, even though there were ones before him. 
        Went to gather vine cuttings from Spain and France.</p>
    <p>There is some <span class="important-terms">phylloxera</span>, but it is contained. <span class="region">Hunter valley</span>, for instance, is bug free as of today.</p>
    <p>Key moment: in 1912 <span class="important-terms">“Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area"</span> </p>
    <p>Massive project that brings water from <span class="region">Murrumbidgee</span>
         (a tributary of the Murray River) to <span class="region">Riverina region</span>. 
        About 29% of Australia’s total wine is produced here.</p>
    <p>The main Climatic influencers: Pacific Ocean and The great dividing range. </p>

    <h3>Hunter Valley Zone</h3>

    <p><span class="region">Hunter Valley Zone</span> contains <span class="region">Hunter GI</span>, 
        which has 3 GI sub-regions: <span class="region">Upper Hunter Valley</span>, 
        then two that get made fun of : <span class="region">Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin</span>. 
        Traditionally <span class="region">Pokolbin and Fordwich</span> were an area known as “<span class="region">Lower Hunter Valley</span>” 
        but the authorities said it didn’t merit a region…Lot’s of people say Hell No to the weird
         <span class="region">“pokolbin”</span> name.</p>
        <p>Other sub-regions of <span class="region">Hunter Valley Zone</span>: 
            (not all GI) <span class="region">Allandale, Belford, Dalwood and Rothbury</span> (in addition to <span class="region">Pokolbin and Fordwich</span>)</p>
    <p>Hunter Valley Climate: warm and wet (one of the most) Sub-tropical and humid.
        <span class="region">Upper Hunter</span> is Region IV (suited for fortified wine) and hotter than <span class="region">Riverland</span> 
        (south Australia’s hottest GI) but less so than <span class="region">Riverina</span>!!! So, ripening comes early and unimpeded (hot nights). </p>
    <p>Top varieties in <span class="region">Hunter GI</span>, <span class="region">Lower Hunter</span>: 
        Semillon, Chardonnay, Verdelho, Shiraz (with a smattering of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon).</p>
    <p>In the past, Semillon was sold as “Hunter Riesling” which kind of points to its acidity. 
         Usually the alcohol is low (10-12%) very acidic (pH of around 2.9) No oak, no lees is common. 
         Usually aged for is makers for many years prior to release 
         (where it can gain browned toast and creme caramel notes to go with its lemon and grass youthful notes)</p>
    <p>Top Examples: Tyrrell’s “Vat 1” and Brokenwoods’ “ILR Reserve” 5-6 years after vintage released. </p>
    <p>Note: Tyrrell was the first to bottle varietal Chardonnay in Australia “1971 Vat 47 Pinot Chardonnay”</p>
   
    <h3>Central Ranges Zone</h3>
   
    <p>There are 3 regions in <span class="region">Central Ranges</span>. 
        They are on the Western slopes of the <span class="region">Great Dividing Range</span>, 
        near a town called <span class="region">Bathurst</span> (125 miles west of <span class="region">Sydney</span>).</p>
    <p><span class="region">Mudgee GI</span> (the oldest) Compared to <span class="region">Hunter GI</span>,
         it is drier, sunnier and less humid. Larger Diurnal shifts too! Wines tend 
         to be concentrated and highly colored. Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Merlot. 80% red grapes. </p>
    <p>South West of <span class="region">Mudgee: Orange GI</span>. 
        Youngest, coolest and most exciting region in the <span class="region">Central Ranges</span>.
         Highest region in the COUNTRY overall. It begins at the 600 meter line, goes up to the 1000 meter mark.</p>
    <p>Highest point: <span class="region">Mount Canobolas</span>, an extinct volcano. 
        Source of the region's rich, basalt-derived soils. Same grapes as <span class="region">Mudgee</span>,
         but also some Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.</p>
    <p>Then <span class="region">Cowra GI</span>: southernmost and warmest region. 
        Known for its soft, generous Chardonnays.</p>

    <h3>South Coast, Northern Rivers, and Northern Slopes Zones</h3>
    
    <p>You take the <span class="region">South Coast and Northern Rivers</span>, 
        and that’s almost the entirety of the <span class="region">New South Wales coastline</span>.
         (just a little segment of <span class="region">Hunter Valley</span>).</p>
    <p>Within <span class="region">Northern Rivers: Hastings River GI</span>. Right on the ocean. 
        VERY HOT. Region V. Experiences the most rainfall during the growing season in Australia. 
        Some early picked Semillon can be like hunter valley, but in general, not considered a fine wine region.</p>
    <p><span class="region">Northern Slopes’ New England Australia GI</span>, make some cooler shiraz. 
        But honestly, it doesn't make a ton.</p>
    <p>The rest of the little regions: who cares. <span class="region">Shoalhaven Coast GI</span>. Best known for wine from 
        Chambourcin: a red French hybrid. </p>
    <p><span class="region">Southern Highlands GI</span>, more potential. Surprisingly, Tempranillo is the most planted.</p>

    <h3>Big Rivers Zone</h3>

    <p>Along the <span class="region">Victoria</span> border, west of <span class="region">Great Dividing Range</span>.
          The big rivers: <span class="region">Murray and Murrumbidgee</span>. 
        While South Australia’s <span class="region">Riverland</span> is the largest single region in Australia, <span class="region">Big Rivers</span>
         is the top producing zone in the country. Chardonnay, then Shiraz and Semillon. 
        </p>
    <p>McWilliams and De Bortoli were early leaders, but now Casella Wines leads. They produce yellow tail.</p>
    <p>This region isn’t just mass-market though. They can make small amounts of high-end Botrytis dessert wine.
         1958 McWilliam was the first one to give it a try. De Bortoli took the ball and ran with it. Now their 
         “Noble One” (debuted in 1982)  botrytis semillon is the star.</p>

    <h3>Southern New South Wales Zone</h3>

    <p>Located within the <span class="region">Great Dividing Range</span>, and encompassing
         the <span class="region">Australian Capital Territory</span> (They call it the ACT).</p>
    <p><span class="region">Canberra District GI</span> surrounds the national capital 
        (<span class="region">Canberra</span>) and is the most important region for the zone.
         Mild, continental climate, kind of like the northern Rhone. </p>
    <p>Region really started when, in 1971, Edgar Riek planted vines on the shores
         of <span class="region">Lake George</span> and John Kirk planted his 
         <span class="region">Clonakilla vineyard in Murrumbateman</span>. </p>
    <p><span class="region">Hilltops GI</span>: Warm, continental. Cabernet Sauvignon
         and Shiraz. Red, about 4 in 5. Compared to <span class="region">Canberra</span>,
          fruit tends to be deeper in color, lower acid and more robust tannins and 
         darker fruit</p>
    <p><span class="region">Gundagai GI</span> (has <span class="region">Murrumbidgee</span> flowing 
        through it) is next to <span class="region">Hilltops Southern border</span>. Some vineyards 
        have emerged here, but region is still in its infancy. <span class="region">Tumbarumba GI</span>, 
        south of <span class="region">Gundagai</span>, in the foothills of the <span class="region">Snowy Mountains</span>,
         and has a cooler climate, well suited to sparkling wine production. 
         Chardonnay and Pinot Noir are about 90% of fruit. 
        </p>
