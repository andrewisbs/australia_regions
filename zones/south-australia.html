        <h1>South Australia</h1>
            <img src="../images/southaustralia.jpg" alt ="a small map of South Australia">
        <h2>Capital: Adelaide</h2>'
            <p>History. Used to stand in Victoria’s shadows, but then phylloxera helped it along 
            (late 1800’s). Victoria’s wine industry was decimated, but South Australia’s was just fine…</p>
            <p>Today, it is still Phylloxera free.</p>
            <p>About 50% of the national total comes from this state. Most of the largest wine 
            groups (e.g. accolade wines and premium wine brands
             (pernod ricard(oh god, triple parentheses????))) operate here.</p>
        <h3>Barossa Zone</h3>
            <p>history, 1847 Bavarian immigrant Johann Gramp planted a vineyard along the banks of Jacob’s 
            creek in rowland flat. Established Orlando wines. 1st commercial winery to operate out of the
             region. Barossa has over 100 ha of vines that are AT LEAST a century old (no phylloxera 
             makes that more possible). </p>
        <h3>The Barossa Old Vine Charter</h3>
            <p>a self-regulated classification of vineyard age:
                Four designations: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Old: 35 Years</li>
            <li>Survivor: 70 Years</li>
            <li>Centenarian: 100 Years</li>
            <li>Ancestor: 125 Years</li>
        </ol>
