    <h1>Australia</h1>
    <h2>Big Themes</h2>
    <h3>Main points about Australia as a whole.</h3>
    <p>Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, as federation brought a relaxation of the interstate trade barriers. 
        Today, the state of South Australia is the biggest producing state, and it annually produces 51% of the nation’s grapes, 
        and most of Australia’s largest wine groups are headquartered there.</p>
    
    <p>Wine australia: est 1981 as Australia wine and brandy corporation</p>
    
   <p> Introduced the “label integrity program” in 1990. 85% rules.</p>
    
    <p>To join the EU, they needed to have their own, strictly defined wine regions. 
        So they modified the act of 1980 and created the Geographical Indications Committee. 
        Appellation system rolled out in 1994. </p>
    
    <h3>In this order: states, zone, regions and sub regions</h3>
    
    <em>Regions and sub-regions: requirements:</em>
    <ul>
        <li>single tracks of land</li>
        <li>5 independently owned vineyards, each at least 5 hA each. </li>
        <li>Minimum output (annually) of 500 tonnes of wine grapes. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In 2011, they signed an agreement with EU to phase out place names</p>
    
    <p> One of the big ones: Tokay was phased out in rutherglen (finally done 2020) </p>
    
    <p>Tokay became ‘topaque’ and sherry ‘apera,’ australian play on aperitif</p>
    <em>Big names in Australia's technological Wine domination:</em>
    <ul>
    <li>Australian wine research institute (AWRI)</li>
    <li>Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)</li>
    </ul>
    Both these are in Adelaide. There’s also the University of Adelaide!
    
    Chaptalization is illegal. Acidification with tartaric acid is legal and used all the time. (makes sense, it’s so hot, on average, throughout Australia)
    
    Australians developed the bag in box technology. 
    
    
    Notes: These are just general comments about Australia. We will dive into more specifics as we start looking into individual states.
